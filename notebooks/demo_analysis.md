# Demo Analysis (example)

This is a short, reproducible example of an analysis a stakeholder might request.

1) Business question: What is monthly revenue by marketplace and top 5 products by revenue?

2) Example SQL (run against the `analytics` schema generated by dbt):

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', orders.order_date) AS month,
  products.product_category_name AS category,
  SUM(orders.total_order_value) AS revenue
FROM {{ ref('fact_orders') }} orders
JOIN {{ ref('dim_products') }} products ON orders.product_key = products.product_key
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 3 DESC;
```

3) Visualization: export result as CSV and plot in a BI tool or use pandas/matplotlib in a notebook.

4) Next steps: add segmentation by customer cohort, return rate analysis, and funnel conversion attribution.
