# Upwork-style Case Study — olist_ebiz (Example)

This is an example case study and portfolio piece modeled for senior Upwork consultants. Figures below are illustrative and should be adapted to match real client outcomes.

## Client
Olist e-commerce analytics team (hypothetical example)

## Problem
The client needed a reliable, auditable analytics pipeline to track orders, revenue attribution, and customer lifetime value across multi-region markets. Existing reports were slow (multi-day latency), frequently inconsistent, and required manual reconciliation.

## Solution
- Implemented a robust dbt modeling layer with incremental models and thorough schema tests
- Orchestrated jobs with Airflow and implemented retries, SLAs, and alerting
- Added automated data quality tests and a monitoring playbook
- Delivered stakeholder-ready docs and performance dashboards

## Impact
- Reduced reporting latency from days to < 4 hours for core metrics
- Eliminated key data discrepancies and reduced time-to-insight by ~30%
- Enabled experiments and promotions optimization that improved ROI (example projection: $100k–$1M annualized impact depending on client scale)

## Engagement scope & timeline
- Phase 1 (4 weeks): discovery, profiling raw data, initial staging models
- Phase 2 (6 weeks): core marts, automated tests, Airflow orchestration
- Phase 3 (Ongoing): monitoring, knowledge transfer, optional retainer for ops & improvements

## Pricing & commercial model (example)
- Fixed-price engagement for initial implementation (e.g., $75k–$200k depending on complexity)
- Monthly retainer for support and ops (e.g., $5k–$20k/month)

## Why this demonstrates $1M-level expertise
Senior consultants who scale to $1M+ on platforms like Upwork typically combine: enterprise clients, repeat retainers, multi-project engagement, and strong delivery outcomes (measurable business impact). This repository and deliverables mirror the type of engineering rigor, documentation, and commercial packaging that such consultants use.
